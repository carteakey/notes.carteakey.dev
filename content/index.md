Hello There 👋 - Welcome to my "Digital Garden".

Inspired by [many](https://jzhao.xyz/), I've decided to create a garden of my personal knowledge, interesting things and anything that would not fit in the sphere of a [regular blog](https://www.carteakey.dev/posts). 

I've created personal websites, blogs, and other stuff as a sort of expression of my own learning, and exposing my stupidity and naivety to the public - just letting it out there myself before they find out 😅.

So naturally i've begun on this conquest. The benefits i foresee, in no order of preference are

- I use & love Obsidian already and having my local notes get directly published to my website is awesome.
- It scraps the need to publish half-baked ideas through blogs and the friction that comes with it.
- Writing notes in public might make me distill information better and push to better quality. 
- I just find it cool.
- Most importantly - the philosophy behind this is succinctly defined by below quote as mentioned by [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/philosophy), which this is built on. 

> “[One] who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but [they] also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important.”
> — Richard Hamming

I constantly have to remind myself that knowledge is not a wikipedia dump of everything you've heard or seen. It has to be relevant, dense, and be worth saving, not just something that is a google search away.
